  I have a deep interest in how data, cities, and people intersect. I’ve spent over 10 years working on projects that aim to make communities safer and more resilient, often through the lens of geospatial analysis, public security, and evidence-based policy.

  My journey has taken me from Mexico to the UK and beyond, working with law enforcement agencies, government bodies, and researchers to tackle tough questions about crime, risk, and justice. I hold a PhD in Security and Crime Science from UCL, but I still get excited by a good map, a sharp dataset, or a chance to collaborate with others who care about making meaningful change.

  I'm passionate about the power of analysis to inform action — and about mentoring others along the way. Whether I’m designing a spatial risk model or writing a briefing for policy makers, I try to keep people at the heart of the work.
