Welcome to my website, a digital space thoughtfully curated into four distinct sections designed to share my insights and work. 

Begin your exploration in the Blog, where you'll find a collection of my past writings alongside fresh, new pieces on various topics. 

Next, delve into Projects, a dedicated area showcasing my passion for data through compelling visualisations, maps and interactive dashboards built around subjects that genuinely interest me. 

Follow, visit Talks, where you can watch videos of presentations I've delivered, offering a glimpse into my past speaking engagements.

Completing my Doctoral thesis has been a significant milestone, and I am thrilled to share it with you here. You'll find a dedicated entry for each chapter, along with a general description of the entire work. This project represents years of dedication, and I am incredibly proud to present it.

I hope you enjoy this site and please, do not hesitate in communicate if you have any doubt or feedback. Thank you.
