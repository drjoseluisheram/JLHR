### “Security? Being able to pay the bills? The government's actions? Those are some of the issues that concern Mexicans the most. What is the Mexican government doing to address these worries?”

Security? Being able to pay the bills? The government's performance? These are some of the issues that concern Mexicans the most. What is their government doing to address these worries?

Regarding the federal administration, various perspectives have analysed the potential public security implications of a consolidating militarisation process in the country, and how this could impact the institutional development of civilian security agencies. While a range of voices have expressed concerns based on their technical knowledge and experience, and even from a purely political standpoint, little attention has been given to the views of society so far.

On countless occasions, the president and his supporters have used INEGI data to assert that the Armed Forces are the institutions with the highest public perception and trust. While it is true that the Navy and Army enjoy the most public confidence, it's also worth noting that they have lost some percentage points compared to previous years. According to the 2022 National Survey of Victimisation and Perception of Public Security (ENVIPE), both the Navy and the Army saw a decline in public trust compared to the previous year, and even an increase in the perception of corruption.

The ENVIPE survey has established itself as a reliable source of information for proposing and developing informed public policy. One of the most significant findings in this latest release highlights the public's primary concerns. These were as follows:
{{< figure src="css-grid-cover.png" alt="Traditional right sidebar layout" caption="A visual example of the traditional right sidebar layout" >}}

Unsurprisingly, insecurity is the issue that troubles Mexicans the most. Sixty-one out of every 100 Mexicans over 18 state that this is what causes them the greatest unease and directly impacts their quality of life. Following this, rising prices (at 34%) and unemployment (at 32%) were the most frequently mentioned concerns. If these are the public's primary worries, I ask again: are the three levels of government implementing effective public policies to mitigate these concerns?

As this column begins, the federal government has staked everything on militarisation to control the activities of organised crime groups that so severely affect the perception of insecurity. However, the data does not align with government propaganda. On the contrary, more homicides and femicides have been recorded than in any other six-year term; there have been countless displays of firepower by groups linked to illicit substance trafficking; similarly, freight transport robberies and illegal fuel extraction are at extremely high levels, alongside prevalent fraud, extortion, and various other types of theft.

And not to mention public policy aimed at containing inflation, or boosting economic activity and recovering jobs. The federal administration continues to rely on welfare policies and to construct projects that will have no significant impact in the coming years. What is evident, however, is that President López Obrador's administration continues to dismantle and weaken institutions; with its actions, it will only further erode the few institutions that still command public trust.

Incidentally, the presidential elections are just around the corner. We are about to be inundated with a deluge of public policy proposals; once again, candidates will come to sell us magical solutions. Will there be professionals who truly understand their responsibility? Will their advisors provide them with useful information like the ENVIPE? Indeed, will they even know what genuinely concerns Mexicans?

Let's strive to be a critical society, a society that analyses; let's not settle for TikTok-style candidates who merely dance and are "amusing." 

### More analysis, more criticism, and fewer "likes."
